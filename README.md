# UrinalsAssignment
In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle.
